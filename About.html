<div> <section class = 'container'> <h1> About Wall Pockets! </h1>  

	 <div> <p class = 'story container col-md-6 col-sm-6'> Once upon a time there was a girl names Sade who had nowehere to put her glasses at night. Her bed was very high up, and she had no nightstand. This problem persisted until her very kind friend Aviva crafted her a Wall Pocket. Suddenly, Sade's evenings were filled with ease rather than frustration. Once their other friends saw Sade's Wall Pocket they asked Aviva if she could make them Wall Pockets too. Each Wall Pocket owner found new and exciting uses for their Pockets, from holding their glasses, to their phones, to their toothbrushes, to their pencils. You too can make your life a little easier by purchasing a Wall Pocket today and finding new and creative places to put them. Visit our Facebook page "Wall Pockets by Aviva" or Email <a href="mailto:WallPocketsbyAviva@gmail.com?Subject=Wall%20Pocket!" target="_top">WallPocketsbyAviva@gmail.com</a> to order your very own Wall Pocket. </P> </div>
